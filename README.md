# Metrics
Initially, the model will be tasked with distinguishing between malicious versus benign network traffic. Malignent in this case will be any one of the following:
Backdoor, Bot, Brute Force, DoD, DDoS, Exploits, Fuzzers, Infiltration, Injection, mit, Ransomware, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Shellcode, Theft, Worm, xss. <br />
Attacks of different kinds will be grouped together so as to prevent some "loss" to the business. Obviously, the response to a ransomware atack would be costlier than the response to a threat actors simoly scanning a network. The impetus is on identifying malicious traffic, however, so network personnel can respond. <br />
<br />
The value to the business then is twofold: <br />
Better response time and more advantageous interaction with identified threats (time spent looking at true attacks versus benign traffic) <br />
Decreased cost in replacement of comrpomised assets <br />

<br />
The average cost of a data breach/cyber incident in the United States is well over $1 million (IBM Cost of a Data Breach). The size of the business drastically affects this number. According to Indeed, the average cost of a Network Engineer in the US is roughly $88,000. In general, the goal will be to better allocate the resources of network/IT employees and, also, protect against cyer incidents.
