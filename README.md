# Metrics
Initially, the model will be tasked with distinguishing between malicious versus benign network traffic. Categories of malignant traffic in this case will be any one of the following:
Backdoor, Bot, Brute Force, DoS, DDoS, Exploits, Fuzzers, Infiltration, Injection, MITM, Ransomware, Reconnaissance, Scanning, Shellcode, Theft, Worm, XSS. <br />
Attacks of different kinds will be grouped together so as to prevent some "loss" to the business. Obviously, to remediate a ransomware atack would be costlier than the a threat actor simply scanning a network. The impetus is on identifying malicious traffic, however, so network personnel can respond. <br />
<br />
The value to the business then is twofold: <br />
Better response time and more advantageous interaction with identified threats (time spent looking at true attacks versus benign traffic) <br />
Decreased costs in replacing compromised assets <br />

<br />
The average cost of a data breach/cyber incident in the United States is well over $1 million (IBM Cost of a Data Breach). According to Indeed, the average salary of a Network Engineer in the US is roughly $88,000. In general, the goal will be to better allocate the resources of network/IT employees and, also, prevent spending to recover from an incident. Depending on the size of the business, this could result in 5% savings in network defense budget.

### Peer Reviewed Comments:
- Really awesome idea, especially considering the data is essentially brand new! Are there any other models you have found that decipher malicious vs benign network traffic with some outdated data? It could be interesting to reference any older models if you have found anything on this. I have few comments to add on the idea though. This sounds great! Can't wait to see what the results look like. :) 
- This is a minor edit as there are no substantial edits I see necessary, but it could be interesting to add how much more costly breaches will continue to get in the future. I don't know much about security, but I can only assume the breaches will continue to become more and more damaging and thus more costly.
