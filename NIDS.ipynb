        "#Network Intrusion Detection System Classifier\n",
        "\n",
        "###Background\n",
        "Network Intrusion Detections Systems (NIDS) have been used in network defense for quite some time. It is of great importance, however, to keep NIDS systems updated to identify new and evolving attack types. Researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia have produced consolidated datasets to include attacks against IoT devices and data comprising attacks against multiple test networks. Of particular interest here as well is that the data is, essentially, brand new. \n",
        "\n",
        "###Description\n",
        "The work in this project will focus on using the provided data to create a Machine Learning model that can be used to create a NIDS in my home lab. This is something I have wanted to do for quite some time. I do not have any IoT devices running in the lab at the moment but may in the future and will aply the IoT data here as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Metric\n",
        "For now, the goal will be to classify traffic reflected in the dataset - bot, recon, worm, etc - with a score of 60% to allow for human intervention/triage. At the moment, I'm not too worried about DoS as I do not think anyone is DoS'ing me.\n",
